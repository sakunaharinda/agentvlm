Code repository for the paper "AGentVLM: Access Control Policy Generation and Verification Framework with Language Models". AGentVLM is a framework developed to use language models and large language models to,
* Identify natural language policies (NLACPs) from high-level requirement specification documents of an organization (using [BERT LM](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert#transformers.BertModel))
* Translate identified NLACPs into structured representations separating access control rules (ACRs) with five policy components: subjects, actions, resources, purposes, and conditions (using [LLaMa 3 8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B))
* Automatically verify the generated structured representations and provide feedback to the administrators if the representation is incorrect, mentioning the reason/error (using [BART LM](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large)) and the location of the error in the generated policy (using integrated gradients feature attribution via [Captum](https://captum.ai/docs/attribution_algorithms#integrated-gradients)).

By developing this framework, we improve the reliability of the automated policy generation process and, in turn, reduce the data breaches due to access control failures in the future.

### Checkpoints

Download the checkpoints necessary to reproduce the results
```bash
$ gdown --folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1404ix73aV_aUbbjntXxIrqkjr8e9PyMw 
```

## Inference

The easiest way to reproduce the results reported in the paper is to run the trained models on the prepared datasets used in the paper. To this end, we will explain how to run the models for each step of the framework in the following sections.
### NLACP Identification

To reproduce the results for NLACP identification step, run the following commands with `<mode> = [collected|ibm|t2p|acre|cyber|overall]`

```bash
$ cd identification/
$ python evaluate_classification.py --mode=<mode>
```

Options:
```
$ python evaluate_classification.py --help
Usage: evaluate_classification.py [OPTIONS]

Evaluates the NLACP identification module.

Options:
  --mode [t2p|acre|ibm|collected|cyber|overall]
                                  Mode of training (document-fold you want to evaluate the trained model on) [default: t2p; required]
  --batch_size INTEGER            Batch size  [default: 16]
  --device TEXT                   GPU/CPU  [default: cuda:0]
```

### Access control policy generation

When evaluating the proposed framework's ability to generate structured representations from the identified NLACP, we follow two main approaches as mentioned in the paper.
1. Evaluating its ability to extract policy components from NLACPs
    * SAR : Extracting subjects and resources for each action (to compare with previous research as they cannot extract any other components)
    * SARCP : By going beyond all the existing frameworks, extracting subjects, resources, purposes, and conditions for each action
2. Evaluating its ability to generate ACRs directly from NLACPs (NOTE: Each ACR should contain its own access decision (which is not considered in existing frameworks), subject, action, resource, purpose, and condition)

#### SAR setting evaluation

To reproduce the results under the SAR setting as reported in the paper, either load the model utilizing the downloaded checkpoints and evaluate on the dataset using the following commands with `<mode> = [collected|ibm|t2p|acre|cyber]`

```bash
$ cd generation/evaluation/
$ python eval_generator_sar_batch.py --mode=<mode>
```

Options:
```
$ python eval_generator_sar_batch.py --help
Usage: eval_generator_sar_batch.py [OPTIONS]

  Batch-wise evaluation of the access control policy generation module considering only subjects, actions, and resources of the generated policies

Options:
  --mode [t2p|acre|ibm|collected|cyber]
                                  Mode of training (document-fold you want to
                                  evaluate the trained model on)  [default:
                                  t2p; required]
  --batch_size INTEGER            Batch size  [default: 8]
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```
Or

use the pre-saved entities for each document-fold to generate the comparison between our framework and the related frameworks by running the following command.

```bash
$ python generate_comparison.py
```

#### SARCP setting with ACR generation capability evaluation

To reproduce the results reported under the SARCP setting (i.e., component extraction) and ACR generation from NLACPs by loading the checkpoints, run the following command with `<mode> = [collected|ibm|t2p|acre|cyber|overall]`.

```bash
$ cd generation/evaluation/
$ python eval_generator_sarcp_batch.py --mode=<mode>
```

Options:
```
$ python eval_generator_sarcp_batch.py --help
Usage: eval_generator_sarcp_batch.py [OPTIONS]

  Batch-wise evaluation of the access control policy generation module considering subjects, actions, resources, purposes, and conditions, as well as individual ACR decisions

Options:
  --mode [t2p|acre|ibm|collected|cyber|overall]
                                  Mode of training (document-fold you want to evaluate the trained model on)  [default: t2p; required]
```

After running the above command, it will result in two F1 scores, one showing the ability to extract components and the other showing the ability to generate ACRs. 
>NOTE: Here, we run the trained model on the `overall` dataset together with the verification model to output verification results (if necessary) to evaluate the verifier.

Furthermore, similar to the SAR setting, pre-saved entities can also be used to get the F1 score of component extraction using the following command with `<mode> = [collected|ibm|t2p|acre|cyber|overall]`.

```bash
$ python srl_results_sarcp.py --mode=<mode>
```

### Access control policy verification

To reproduce the results for the verifier, run the following command.

```bash
$ cd verification/
$ python eval_verifier.py
```
The above command will result in classification reports based on the predictions for the `overall` dataset.

Next we will see how to train each component of our proposed framework with your own data.
